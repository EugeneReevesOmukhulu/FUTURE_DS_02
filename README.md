Project Overview
This analysis focuses on exploring IPL data to answer key questions around team success, player performances, high-scoring venues, and much more. The project demonstrates data preparation, visualization, and insights generation, using Power BI’s interactive and powerful visualization tools.

Objectives
Analyze Team Performances: Identify win/loss ratios, success rates by season, and team-specific trends.
Examine Player Statistics: Highlight top scorers, strike rates, and frequent match-winners.
Venue Analysis: Explore how venue locations impact game scores and identify the most scoring-friendly stadiums.
Seasonal Trends: Identify year-over-year patterns for runs scored, wickets taken, and match outcomes.

Data Preparation
Data preparation involved:

Exploring Tables and Relationships: Reviewing fields for critical metrics and attributes (e.g., dates, teams, player names).
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Using Power Query to format and clean data for accurate analysis (e.g., splitting names, converting date formats).
Metrics Calculation: Creating custom measures, such as strike rate, total runs, wickets taken, and venue-based averages.
Visualizations
The project includes the following Power BI visualizations:

Team Performance Dashboard: Bar charts showing wins/losses by team across seasons.
Player Stats: Scatter plot for player strike rate vs. average runs and tables for top players.
Match Outcomes: Pie chart showing types of wins (by runs or wickets).
Venue Insights: Map visualization for stadium locations and high-level score averages.
Seasonal Trends: Line charts to track yearly trends in total runs, average scores, and match counts.
Insights
Here are some of the key insights gained from this analysis:

Consistent Teams: Teams with high success rates over seasons.
Impactful Players: Frequent “player of the match” winners and high-performing individuals.
High-Scoring Venues: Stadiums that typically yield higher scores.
Thrilling Matches: Matches won with narrow margins, indicating closely contested games.
